its not a big deal :) .. 

First of all set-up your stripe account 

Second try to create a file named ".env.local" which will contain the variables environnements that you will find in the developer dashboard section in stripe 

once all good .. you can add the node_modules with "npm install"

after that run the app with "npm run dev"

for any question feel free to make a PR or you can contact me (check the portfolio)

Happy coding :)
